print(24/3 ) #Divide between two numbers
print("Hello " + "World!") # Concatenate two strings together (any words)
MyList =["Hello","Python",12,23.6]  #Create a list of 4 items (can be strings, numbers, both)
MyList.append("DSC530")  #Append an item to your list (again, can be a string, number)
my_tuple = ("Madhukar", "Ayachit", 48, "Solution Architect") #Create a tuple with 4 items (can be strings, numbers, both)
